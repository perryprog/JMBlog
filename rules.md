We don't like rules much, so just use common sense and we won't need to use them:

#### General
- We do not tolerate harassment. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
  - offensive or discriminatory comments, pictures, or videos related to:
    - gender (including identity, history, or expression)
    - sexual orientation
    - disability
    - physical appearance
    - race
    - religion
  - sexual images and languages in public spaces
  - stalking
  - unwelcome sexual attention
  - calls for violence against members
  - inciting members to violence or self-harm
- Cursing is fine, but a chat filter may be turned on my default. You can toggle it with `/nofilter`
- No spamming or excessive caps, it makes chat harder to read.
- No advertising other minecraft or discord servers.
- Voice chat is not moderated. Use at your own risk.
- Common Sense: Just have some common sense. Please.
- Griefing: surprise, it's not allowed and won't be tolerated! Think about how they would feel if you stole their hard-earned items or messed up their base.
- Inappropriate skins or usernames aren't allowed. You will get a warning → kick → one day ban (until you change your skin/username)
- Failure to follow these rules will generally result in a warning → a mute → one day ban → 7 day ban → perm ban, unless otherwise specified


#### JustCreative
- Only Creators+ Can go in freebuild. End of story, no exceptions.
- Inappropriate plots will be modified to make them more appropriate. Multiple violations will lead to further inappropriate plots being locked, and the player losing access to claiming new plots.


#### JustSurvival
- Hacked clients are not OK, one warning, then a one day, seven day, and finally a perm ban. (Hacked clients are any clients that have been modified to provide an unfair gameplay advantage)
- X-Ray is considered cheating, and has the same consequences as the bullet above.
- Killing is allowed only if pvp is on for both players. Combat-logging (such as using /spawn or disconnecting to escape combat) is allowed.
- If you /trust a player, you are taking responsibility for their actions, including if they ruin your base. A moderator may help you find out who griefed you, and may punish them, but your base will not be restored to normal.
- There are no grief protections on the main end island (the one with the dragon), do not build anything important there


#### JustMinigames
JustMinigames includes JustMinecraft minigames such as Switch and Bedwars.
- Cheating is not allowed. If you cheat, you will be banned without a warning. Cheating includes using a modified client to gain an unfair advantage over other players.
- Teaming is not allowed. If you are not in the same team as another player, you mustn't work together to gain an advantage over other players.
